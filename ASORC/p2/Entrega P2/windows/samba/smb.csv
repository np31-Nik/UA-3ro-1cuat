You should expect this event when modifying the default values of NullSessionShares and NullSessionPipes. On a typical file server, these settings do not exist or do not contain values, which is the most secure configuration. By default, domain controllers populate the NullSessionShares entry with netlogon, samr, and lsarpc to allow legacy access methods."

Guidance:

You should expect this event when Windows Firewall is not configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that does not have custom shares configured. Clients cannot access SMB shares on this computer until SMB traffic is allowed through the firewall."
