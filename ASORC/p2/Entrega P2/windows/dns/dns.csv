Warning,11/14/2021 6:22:07 AM,Microsoft-Windows-DNS-Server-Service,414,None,"The DNS server computer currently does not have a DNS domain name.  Its DNS name is a single-label host name with no domain (for example:  ""host"" rather than ""host.microsoft.com""). 
 
You might have forgotten to configure a primary DNS domain for the server computer. 
 
Because the DNS server has only a single-label name, all zones created will have default records (SOA and NS) created using only this single-label name for the server's host name.  This can lead to incorrect and failed referrals when clients and other DNS servers use these records to locate this server by name.

  1) Click Start, and then click Control Panel.
  2) Open System and Maintenance , and then open System. 
  3) Click Change Settings, and then click Change.  4) Click either Domain or Workgroup, and then type the name of the domain or  workgroup you want the computer to join; the domain or workgroup name will be used as your DNS domain name. 
  5) When prompted, restart the computer.
