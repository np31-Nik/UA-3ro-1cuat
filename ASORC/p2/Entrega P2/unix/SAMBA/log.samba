  At this time the 'samba' binary should only be used for either:
  'server role = active directory domain controller' or to access the ntvfs file server with 'server services = +smb' or the rpc proxy with 'dcerpc endpoint servers = remote'
  You should start smbd/nmbd/winbindd instead for domain member and standalone file server tasks

  exit_daemon: daemon failed to start: Samba detected misconfigured 'server role' and exited. Check logs for details, error code 22
